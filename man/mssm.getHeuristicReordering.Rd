\title{Heuristic ordering of the columns}
\usage{
mssm.getHeuristicReordering(javaMatrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{javaMatrix}{a Java two-dimensionnal array of double.}
}
\value{
A vector of the columns indices to be investigated first.
}
\description{
Returns an ordering of the column indices to improve the search of
\code{\link[=mssm.search.cpgc]{mssm.search.cpgc()}}.
Columns are sorted on the descending sum of their positive entries.
This sum is computed as the sum of the entries (in the column) that
are positive.
The purpose of this function is to provide one (among many possible)
heuristic ordering of the columns to be used in the subsequent search.
